# Welcome to MineCart!

Ever felt you wanna order your college supllies but they are too costly for the small number of items you want? We present to you, MineCart, a college-wide e-commerce application.
Its sole goal: to get students who want to buy similar products, to order a single shipment to reduce per item price.

Although still under development, given below is the current structure of the application.

1. User(Customer/Vendor) Registration
	- Requires
		- Username
		- Email
		- Persona
			- Customer
			- Vendor
		- Password

2. User(Customer/Vendor) Login
	- Authenticates
		- Username
		- Persona
			- Customer
			- Vendor
		- Password
		
3. Vendor: Create new product
	- Requires
		- Name of Product
		- Price per item
		- Quantity (for dispatch)

4. Vendor: View Product List
	- Shows 
		- Name of Product (being sold by Vendor)
		- Price per item
		- Quantity (requirement)
		- Current Quantity fulfilled
		- Status

Although there's still a long way to go, MineCart will keep being developed, and hopefully 
come to the rescue of the hostel dwellers in solving this age old problem ;)
